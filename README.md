## config dir

My .config directory of manifestos.

### Installation

Run `sh doinstall.sh`.  Everything that can be installed automagically will (as long as there's an `install.sh` script found in a folder).

### nvim

I use Neovim primarily, and love it.  I also use Neovim head (0.5.0 as of this writing) for the native Lua support.

I also wrote a plugin manager that was heavily influenced as a starting point by paq, which you see at nvim/plugins.

### git

Various configs and such for Git.  git/config has my aliases and other non-sensitive stuff that I use daily.
